### Objective
Build an executive-ready Power BI report to compare smart fitness tracker usage and satisfaction between cats and dogs, aiding product decisions for a new wearable device.

### Methodology  
- **Data Model**: Used a provided normalized dataset with information on pets, devices, and households.  
- **Visualization**: Created 7+ visual types including bar, line, donut, bubble map, and matrix.  
- **Interactivity**: Implemented slicers (drop-downs, sliders, hierarchy) and dynamic bookmarks for drilldowns and view toggling.  
- **Design**: Applied custom branding and layout using Waggleâ€™s official color palette and icons.

### Key Findings  
- **Engagement**: Dogs showed a clear increase in daily steps post-device, cats less so.  
- **Satisfaction**: Dog owners rated their experience higher on average.  
- **Demographics**: Urban households with higher income owned more pets and had higher engagement.

### Results  
Delivered a 6-page interactive Power BI report used to guide future product direction, integrating advanced slicers, responsive buttons, and storytelling visuals.
