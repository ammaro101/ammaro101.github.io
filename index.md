**Data Engineer | Data Analyst**

Hello World! 

I design and implement scalable data systems that transform business objectives into technical reality. With expertise in data pipelines, cloud architecture, and analytics, I bridge the gap between stakeholder needs and production grade solutions from infrastructure to AI model training and evaluation.

Hereâ€™s what I can deliver for your organization:

â€¢ End-to-End Data Pipelines: Design automated ETL/ELT workflows (Spark, Airflow) with built-in quality checks (Great Expectations) and access controls (IAM) to ensure data integrity, security, and compliance.

â€¢ Requirement Translation: Convert business goals into functional and non-functional technical specifications.

â€¢ Cloud Data Architecture: Build cloud solutions optimized for operational excellence, efficiency, security, reliability, and cost-efficiency

â€¢ KPI-Driven Development: Instrument data pipelines and dashboards to track key performance metrics and deliver excellent data solutions to stakeholders.

â€¢ AI Foundations: Develop and deploy models (Python, tensorflow) with focus on data prep, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Letâ€™s architect data solutions that align with your business and technical imperatives.
