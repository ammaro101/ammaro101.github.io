   - Analyzed the correlation (R² value) between customer ratings and product return rates.
   - Developed linear regression formulas to predict customer sales and incomes.
   - Identified customers predicted to have the highest income.
   - Determined which products would be most effective for advertising.

3. **Visual Reporting**:
   - **Income Distribution**: Created a histogram to visualize income distribution and identify trends.
   - **Household Income by Location**: Mapped income data by geographic location.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Utilized scatter plots with trendlines and calculated R² values to demonstrate relationships between variables.

4. **Further Analysis**: Selected additional variables to explore how they relate to income predictions and sales recommendations, enhancing the overall analysis.
